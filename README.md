# OpenDialog's ChatUI SDK

ChatUI is a software development kit (SDK) developed by [OpenDialog](https://opendialog.ai/) designed to help developers create custom chat components and enhance Conversational AI applications. It allows for interactive chat interfaces, handles events, and supports functionalities like sending messages and managing user interactions. 

The ChatUI SDK can be used in any website or browser-based application and requires a basic understanding of Javascript to set up and, ideally, a little typescript.

If you want to learn more about the ChatUI SDK, check out our [docs site](https://webchat-sdk.opendialog.dev/). If you are looking for more advanced information regarding creating Conversational AI Agents, check out our [OpenDialog platform tutorials](https://docs.opendialog.ai/tutorials/ai-agent-creation-overview).

# Choose Your Own Adventure

The Choose Your Own Adventure app is a highly customised implementation of ChatUI that combines conversation design, SDK events and methods, ChatUI settings and external CSS to create an experience that feels unlike most chat interfaces.

## Components
- ChatUI options
- Custom CSS
- An OpenDialog-powered Conversational AI application, based on the [process handling AI agent template](https://docs.opendialog.ai/getting-started-1/quick-start-ai-agents/a-process-handling-ai-agent)


## Getting started

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

### Project Setup

```sh
yarn
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
yarn build
```

## Use ChatUI SDK in combination with:

[OpenDialog AI](https://opendialog.ai/) : Create your own custom Conversational AI agent with OpenDialogâ€™s all-in-one Conversational AI Agent Management system. Adapt the Choose Your Own Adventure application to your use case, by adapting the conversation design to suit your needs.
